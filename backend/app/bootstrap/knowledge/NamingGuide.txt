## Naming Guide
Goal: Reduce redundancy and pseudo-"high-end", generate short, intuitive names that can be repeated frequently.
---

### Core Principles (By Priority)
- Short and Intuitive: 2–4 characters/words is suitable, max ≤6; avoid multiple modifiers.
- Consistent Tone: Consistent with the subject matter (Ancient/Modern/Sci-Fi), no mix and match.
- Fixed Grading: Choose a grading system and use it consistently (see below).
- Common Terms First: Use "Common Term + Function Description" directly in text.

---

### Character Naming (Quick Use)
- Principle: Fit the era/region, easy to speak and write, few rare characters (max 1), avoid homophones or high duplication with protagonist.
- Template:
  - Urban/Reality: Common Surname + Two Character Name; Nickname/Online Name = [Feature/Occupation] + Title (e.g. Old Zhou, Delivery Brother, Forensic Lin, Boss Zhang).
  - Ancient/Xianxia: Surname + Single Character Name (or Two Character Name); Can set separate "Courtesy Name/Title" (e.g. Gu Heng, courtesy name Ziyan; Qingxuzi, Taoist of Bamboo Hut).
  - Family/Sect: Unified "Generation Character" (e.g. Cheng/Ji/Hong/Shou/Ning/An), peers share one character.
  - Sci-Fi/Western: Formal name uses single language (Chinese or English). Code name only displayed as nickname: Li Ran (Code Name Zero) / Evan Chen (codename Zero) / Li Ran, codenamed Zero.
- Common Surnames (Selection): Li, Wang, Zhang, Liu, Chen, Yang, Huang, Zhao, Zhou, Wu, Zheng, Sun, Hu, Zhu, Gao, Lin, He, Guo, Ma, Luo, Liang, Song, Xie, Tang, Xu, Deng, Feng, Han, Cao, Zeng, Peng, Xiao, Cai, Pan.
- Safe Characters (Few, unisex): An, Ning, Qing, Ran, Chen, Yan, Cheng, Chuan, Heng, Chu, Qing, Zhu, Lan, Xi, Zhou, Yuan, Mu.
- Ancient Imagery (Few): Ji, Yan, Tang, Yuan, Zhou, Mo, Xia, Li, Qing, Ling.
- Generational Tendency (Hint, use carefully to avoid cliche): 80-90s common "Wei/Qiang/Jun/Lei/Jing/Na"; 00s common "Yu/Xuan/Han/Zi".
- Taboo: CEO splicing (e.g. "Ye Beiming, Long Aotian"), multiple rare characters, vulgar homophones, Chinese-English mix in formal name. Note: Can display "Real Name + (Code Name) / Code Name + (Real Name)", but code name is not part of formal name.


---

### Chapter Naming (Quick Use)
- Length: 4–12 words/characters; no multiple punctuation and parenthesis; readable and speakable.
- Tone: Consistent with subject matter; no spoilers for ending, only highlight "high energy point" of this chapter.
- Format:
  - Number: Title; Volume can use Volume Name · Chapter X Title.
  - Multi-part: Upper/Middle/Lower or (1)/(2)/(End), unify one style.
  - Tag (Optional): Fixed small amount at front, e.g. [Extra] [Single Chapter], do not stack multiple tags.
  - Colon: Default no "X:Y" structure colon title; if really needed (to highlight contrast/turning point etc.), suggest ≤1 time per volume, avoid "all colon titles" in whole volume.
- Template:
  - Location + Event: Disappearance in Old School Building, Night Talk at Port
  - Character + Action: Lin Qing Requests Battle, Gu Heng Tests Sword
  - Goal + Obstacle: Chasing Murderer Meets Rain, Prison Break Attempt
  - Object + Clue: Origin of Broken Blade, Sheepskin Scroll Record
  - Time + Turning Point: Visitor at Dawn, Misunderstanding at Dusk
  - Conflict + Result: Night Raid Succeeds, Negotiation Breaks Down
  - Suspense Question (Use Carefully): Who is he exactly? (≤2 times per volume)
  - Dialogue Title: Don't Look Back, Don't Open Door (Pick key four words/short phrase from dialogue)
- Taboo:
  - Pseudo "High-end" pile of words (e.g. "Quantum Star Dome Ultimate Awakening")
  - Long string of punctuation/emoji/multiple tags
  - Homogenized "X:Y" colon titles appearing densely (Will look templated, lose recognition)
  - Key Spoilers (Murderer/Ending written directly)


---

### High Risk Words and Forbidden Combinations (Avoid by default)
- High Risk Words (Forbidden if not corresponding subject): Quantum, Nether, Phantom, Ultimate, Supreme, Star Dome, Eternal, Chaos, Entropy, Rust, Vientiane.
- Forbidden Combinations:
  - System Name stacked with 3+ layers of modifiers (e.g. "Nether Phantom Star Dome System").
  - "Universe Level/Multiverse Level" + Daily Objects.
  - Fantasy x Hard Sci-Fi Word Mix (Unless clearly mixed genre and only pick 1 hard word).

### Default Fallback Writing (Use when not taking formal name)
- Mysterious Fragment (Can absorb resentment and turn wish into power)
- Attribute Panel (Record talent and skills)
- Simulator (Review key choices)
